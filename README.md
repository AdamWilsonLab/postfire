Fire and Climate Change in Fynbos
=====

A workshop in modeling post-fire recovery and ecosystem resilience in _fynbos_ systems.

The workshop will consist primarily of stepping through example code that explores the use of LANDSAT NDVI data in modeling post-fire recovery of _fynbos_.  The materials for the course are all available in a Git Repository at [https://github.com/adammwilson/postfire](https://github.com/adammwilson/postfire).

# Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* Folders
* **workflows:**       Scripts
* **functions:**  Various functions that will be used by scripts.
* **data:**  Datasets used in analyses
* **output:** Temporary output from analysis

# Pre-Workshop Preparation
## Software
Please attempt to have the following software installed and functioning prior to the workshop:

* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
  This includes an installation of R.  Use of RStudio is not vital for the course, participants could use the  GUI included with R or another interface (e.g. [EMACS-ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/) if desired.
* R packages.  These are installed either with a package manager or via the command line (e.g. `install.packages(raster)`).  See for [here for a list of packages](workflow/1_setup.R) that we'll be using.
* [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/download/).  We'll be giving a brief introduction to this full featured open-source GIS in one section of the workshop.  It isn't vital that you have it installed , but if you do, you'll be able to follow along.  If you do, please also install the [spGRASS6](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spgrass6/index.html) R library.
