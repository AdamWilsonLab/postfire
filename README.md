=====

A workshop in modeling post-fire recovery and ecosystem resilience in _fynbos_ systems

# Repository Structure
* workflows
	* Scripts
* functions
	* Various functions that will be used by scripts.
* data
	* Datasets used in analyses
* output
	* Temporary output from analysis

# Pre-Workshop Preparation
## Software
Please attempt to have the following software installed and functioning prior to the workshop:

* R (and the following packages)
  	 * Raster
	 * sp
	 * 
* [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/download/).  We'll be giving a brief introduction to this full featured open-source GIS in one section of the workshop.  It isn't vital that you have it installed , but if you do, you'll be able to follow along.
